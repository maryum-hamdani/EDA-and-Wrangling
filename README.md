# EDA-and-Wrangling
In this EDA and data wrangling endeavor, we delved into a comprehensive FIFA dataset, applying a multitude of analytical techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Wrangling on FIFA Dataset. The dataset, comprising both goalkeepers and outfield players, presented an array of attributes essential for understanding player abilities. 
In this analysis, we undertook a comprehensive exploration and data wrangling of a FIFA dataset to gain insights into the attributes and characteristics of both goalkeepers and outfield players. This study aimed to provide a nuanced understanding of various aspects of player performance, positional differences, and factors influencing player ratings.
# Summary Statistics of Goalkeepers:
The summary statistics of goalkeepers revealed key insights into their performance. Metrics such as 'handling,' 'diving,' and 'reflexes' had high mean values, suggesting that goalkeepers, on average, excel in these attributes. However, the variance in 'handling' indicated varying levels of proficiency among goalkeepers in this crucial skill.
# Summary Statistics of Outfield Players:
Analyzing the summary statistics of outfield players shed light on their overall performance attributes. Variables like 'shooting,' 'passing,' and 'dribbling' had relatively high mean values, implying that outfield players exhibit strong skills in these areas. The variances in these attributes highlighted the diversity of skills among outfield players.
# Group By and Pivoting:
We performed group-by and pivot operations to aggregate and reshape the data. These operations facilitated further analysis by creating informative data structures, enabling us to delve deeper into specific aspects of player performance based on their positions and attributes.
# Visualization of Total Players per Position:
Through visualization, we displayed the total number of players in each position. This plot offered insights into the distribution of players across positions, helping us understand the popularity and prevalence of different roles on the field.
# Distribution of Players' Foot Types:
By showcasing the distribution of players' foot types, we identified the proportion of left-footed and right-footed players. This analysis allowed us to understand the prevalence of each foot type in the dataset.
# Box Plot of Foot Distribution per Rating:
The box plot displaying the 'foot' distribution per 'rating' unveiled how player ratings correlate with their dominant foot. It indicated whether players with a particular foot type tend to have higher or lower ratings.
# Total Players per Foot Type by Position:
We presented the total number of players for each foot type according to their positions. The use of separate graphs for each position while presenting them collectively enabled us to compare foot type distributions across different roles.
# Relationship between Ratings and Defending:
We explored the relationship between player ratings and their defending attributes. This plot illuminated whether higher ratings are associated with better defensive skills, thereby offering insights into the correlation between these variables.
# Relationship between Rating and Goalkeeper Handling:
A graph displaying the relationship between player ratings and goalkeeper handling was generated. Additionally, the distributions of each attribute were presented alongside. This helped us understand how handling proficiency influences a goalkeeper's overall rating.
# Correlation Heatmap:
A heatmap was constructed to reveal correlations among all columns of the goalkeeper dataset. This analysis identified variables that strongly affect goalkeeper ratings, including attributes like 'diving,' 'reflexes,' and 'handling.' Understanding these relationships is crucial for assessing goalkeeper performance.
# Distribution of Player Ratings:
A distribution plot of player ratings was generated, offering insights into the overall distribution of ratings in the dataset. This revealed the most common rating ranges and the presence of any outliers.
# KDE Plot of Player Ratings by Type:
KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plots were employed to visualize the distribution of player ratings for different player types. This allowed us to discern any variations in the distribution patterns among different types of players.
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data wrangling process provided a comprehensive understanding of player performance, positional differences, and factors influencing player ratings in the FIFA dataset. These insights can be invaluable for teams, scouts, and analysts to make informed decisions about player recruitment, strategy, and player development programs. Additionally, the correlations identified in this analysis can guide future research and further enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of football player performance.
